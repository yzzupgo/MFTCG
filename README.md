# MFTCG

## INTRODUCTION

We propose the novice program-oriented Multi-Objective Optimization-Based Fault-Localization Oriented Test Case Generation (MFTCG) for automatically generating test inputs. Specifically, we use multi-objective optimization algorithms to evolve the test case in terms of both fault localization and faulty code detection capability.

## RUNNING
1. Enter the ```/EXP/Code/tools``` and modify the parameter in the 'main' function of ```MakePairs.py```.
2. Run command (```python3 MakePairs.py``` ) in the terminal and a new directory named 'Pairs' will be created in the ```/EXP```.
3. Enter the ```/EXP/Code/tools``` and modify the parameter in the 'parserArgs' function of ```main.py```.
4. Run command (```python3 main.py``` ) in the terminal. 'Deal', 'Tmp' and 'result' will be created and the result are stored in 'result'.
